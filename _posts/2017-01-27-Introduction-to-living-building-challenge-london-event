What if every single act of design and construction made the world a better place?

The Living Building Challenge is the world’s most rigorous proven performance standard for buildings, a regenerative design framework to create spaces that, like a flower, give more than they take.

We would like to invite you to our first event and launch of a Living Building Challenge London Collaborative. 

You can reserve you place for the event on the link below,
